            The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib, meaning "everyone's temple or house" or Darbār Sahib,
             meaning "exalted court", is a Gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.
              It is the holiest Gurdwara and the most important pilgrimage site of Sikhism.
               The temple is built around a man-made pool that was completed by Guru Ram Das in 1577.
                Guru Arjan – the fifth Guru of Sikhism, requested Sai Mir Mian Mohammed – a Muslim Pir of 
                Lahore to lay its foundation stone in 1589. In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth 
                in Harmandir Sahib, calling the site Ath Sath Tirath. The temple was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs 
                after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Muslim armies from
                 Afghanistan and the Mughal Empire. The army led by Ahmad Shah Abdali, for example, demolished it 
                 in 1757 and again in 1762, then filled the pool with garbage and blood of cows.
                  Maharaja Ranjit Singh after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, overla

            The Taj Mahal, is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river
             Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor 
             Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb
              of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, which includes
               a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a
                crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, 
                but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal 
                complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653

          The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone,
           it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.
            The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh,
             the founder of the city of Jaipur, India. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that
              he built this grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior
               is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.
                The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals
                 celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah",
                  which forbade them to appear in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed
                   cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the
                    high temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the
                     front of the palace, but it is the back.

            Vijayanagara Empire. On the south bank of the River Tungabhadra is the
            7th-century Hindu Virupaksha Temple, near the revived Hampi Bazaar. A
            carved stone chariot stands in front of the huge Vittala Temple site.

            bear.
